# First Java Project: My Space Invaders game

Java project created in february 2021 in the optional subject Advanced Programming during the 4th year of the Degree in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. It is a recreation of the original Space Invaders Game. 

The program has been compiled in Java 15.0.1 via IntelliJ IDE.
Through this same IDE I generated a JavaDoc to visualize the structure and design of the program.

<br>
<br>
<h2> Main menu </h2>
When we compile the program, a window opens with this main view. With the arrows on the keyboard we can move the cursor up and down. When we want to enter we just have to click Enter button.

<h2> The game </h2>
The game consists of eliminating the aliens before they reach the line of shields. The player controls the ship at the bottom of the screen. We can move our ship left and right with the arrow keys and shoot with the space bar. Aliens move both horizontally and vertically (gradually lowering). Each dead alien adds a certain score to the player, depending on the alien's color. In the upper left corner we can see the player's score and in the upper right, the lives, which by default start at 3.

We also have a bonus alien, which will appear at the top of the game with a special sound. This alien bonus will give us a random score every time we manage to shoot him:

<h3 align="center"> Animations </h3>
Apart from the movement, the game has several animations, always accompanied by music. The most characteristic are the explosion of the aliens when they come in contact with a bullet of the player, and the explosion of the ship when it comes in contact with a bullet of aliens:

  <img src="https://github.com/migodi15/Space-Invaders/blob/main/img/result/joc4.png" alt="ok2" width=300>
</p>
Also note the animation of the shields, which disappear pixel by pixel, right where they have been hit by the bullet.

<h3 align="center"> End of the game </h3>
The game ends in 3 ways:
â€¢ We lose if we lose our lives after receiving 3 shocks.
â€¢ We lose if an alien touches the shield area, as it took us too long to try to kill them.
â€¢ We win if we manage to kill them all.
Note that to increase the difficulty of each game progressively, the probability of aliens shooting increases inversely proportional to the number of living aliens.

If we lose the game we will see this image, with the 3 blank spaces to enter our name with the keyboard and, if we wish, save the game score:

</p>
Same way if we win:

</p>

<h2> Records </h2>
If in the main menu we are on the second option, we can see the records of the plays in a same computer:
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/migodi15/Space-Invaders/blob/main/img/result/menu2.png" alt="ok2" width=300></p>
If we enter by pressing Enter, I will see the 10 highest saved scores, accompanied by the player's name:

</p>
Note that the two finished games (named MAD and REC) have been entered and placed correctly on the podium.

<h2> Points information </h2>
In the 3rd option of the main menu we can enter by doing Enter as well. Here we only see the score of each type of alien:

</p>
<h2> Exit </h2>
Pressing Enter on the last option in the main menu will close the game.
