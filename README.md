# First Java Project: My Space Invaders game

Java project created in february 2021 in the optional subject Advanced Programming during the 4th year of the Degree in Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. It is a recreation of the original Space Invaders Game. 

The program has been compiled in Java 15.0.1 via IntelliJ IDE.
Through this same IDE I generated a JavaDoc to visualize the structure and design of the program.

<h2> Main menu </h2>
When we compile the program, a window opens with this main view. With the arrows on the keyboard we can move the cursor up and down. When we want to enter we just have to click Enter button.
